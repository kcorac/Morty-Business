## Mechanics Overview
Morty Business is a point-and-click strategy and time management game. The idea is inspired in the fact that the mortuary’s job and labor begins with someone else’s death. The player controls the mortuary agent to manage the coffins that must be buried or cremated according to their shapes and colors.

### Wining Condition(s)
If the player achieves to process a certain amount of coffins they move to the next difficulty level.
